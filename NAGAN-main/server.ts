Here is a step-by-step breakdown of your question:
> "${message}"

#### 1. Core Principle
Every concept is easiest to understand when connected to fundamental laws. At its heart, this topic governs how energy, information, or matter changes state under specific conditions.

#### 2. Everyday Analogy
Think of this like an interconnected system—just as a balance scale shifts when you add weight to one side, this principle maintains equilibrium by counterbalancing opposing forces.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Initial Condition:** State the known variables and foundational assumptions.
2. **Mechanism in Action:** Follow the cause-and-effect chain step by step.
3. **Outcome / Result:** Deduce the final value or observable phenomenon.

#### 4. Exam & Practical Application Tip
- Always define terms clearly in your opening sentence.
- Include units of measurement and specify reference frames.
- Re-check edge cases before concluding.

*Feel free to ask a follow-up question or request a simpler analogy!*`;

**${topic}** is a foundational concept governing how energy, state, or information changes. It establishes the rule through which input conditions dictate observable outcomes.

## 🚲 Everyday Analogy
Imagine water flowing through pipes of different widths: just as pressure and pipe diameter dictate the volume of water moving per second, ${topic} balances driving forces against resistance.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1. **Identify the System Variables:** Establish initial states, constants, and external forces.
2. **Apply the Governing Relation:** Quantify the interaction using standard scientific laws.
3. **Equilibrium or Final Output:** Derive the resulting state and verify units.

## 🌍 Real-World Practical Example
Engineers, scientists, and analysts use ${topic} daily to calculate optimal load capacities, build prediction algorithms, and design resilient hardware.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
- **Misconception:** Assuming that the relationship remains linear across all extreme conditions.
- **Fact:** Always observe boundary constraints and validity ranges.

## 🎯 Key Takeaway for Exams
*Master the foundational definition, state the governing equation with variable units, and remember that conservation laws always hold.*`

- **First Law/Condition:** Energy and matter within an isolated system are strictly conserved.
- **Second Law/Condition:** Spontaneous processes proceed toward thermodynamic or systemic stability.

## 4. Core Concepts & Mechanisms
- Direct proportionality exists between the applied stimulus and observable reaction.
- Boundary conditions define where approximations hold and where non-linear effects dominate.

### 1. Issue Identification & Root Cause
- **Type:** Off-by-one / Logic Flow or Syntax constraint.
- **Diagnostics:** The code attempts an operation outside valid memory or collection bounds, or lacks state update.
- **Primary Fix:** Ensure termination conditions trigger before invalid index accesses occur.

### 2. Corrected Code
\`\`\`${language.toLowerCase()}
${sampleFix}
\`\`\`

### 3. Step-by-Step Fix Explanation
1. Updated loop/condition boundaries to stay strictly within valid indices.
2. Verified that variables are initialized prior to the loop.
3. Added boundary guards to prevent runtime crashes.

### 4. Best Practice Tip
Always write unit tests with edge cases (empty list \`[]\`, single element \`[x]\`, and maximum size) to catch indexing errors immediately.`,
